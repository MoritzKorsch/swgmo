        This is a simple number analysis tool. <br />
        It will calculate the following:<br />
        <br />
        1: The binary representation.<br />
        2: Check if the number is a prime<br />
        3: If the number is less than 10, it will calculate the factorial and print out all the factorials up to that number<br />
        4: Compare the factorial to the factorial of the number 5<br />
        5: Calculate the number times 1024<br />
        6: Generate a password. This is a simple MD5-Hash including a salt. This password is generated twice and then compared to ensure that the password has been generated correctly. The salt is:<br />
        A quarter of the number + the number in percent to 50 + the number itself.<br />
        <br />
        After these actions, the salt generator is checked with default values.<br />
        <br />
        Unfortunately the programmer wrote a horrible code and inserted a bunch of bugs. Can you correct the mistakes and refactor the code?<br />
